          <h2>Why Invest in SEO Today?</h2>
          <h4>
            Search engine optimization isn’t optional — it’s the foundation of
            digital visibility
          </h4>
          <p>
            Over 90% of online experiences begin with a search engine. If your
            business isn’t ranking on page one, you're invisible to your ideal
            customers. Paid ads stop the moment you stop paying. SEO builds
            long-term, sustainable traffic that keeps delivering. With Google’s
            algorithms constantly evolving, it’s not enough to "just have a
            website" — it must be optimized, technically sound, and aligned with
            what your customers are searching for.
